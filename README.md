# JPACRUDProject

##Description
This project allows the user to look at all of the weight lifters in the database and the amount they lifted in lbs across the five different movements inside the table. The user can click on any of names within the table to see only the selected person's lifts. From there they are able to delete any lifter from the database, edit, and create and entirely new lifter to add to the database.
##Lessons Learned
Working on this project I was able to fully understand how to use request mappings, controllers and jsps to interact with one another to make one cohesive project. This project helped a lot with recognizing various web related error codes as well. Overall this project made me much more comfortable with troubleshooting and made me much more familiar with using request mappings.
